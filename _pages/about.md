Interesting project
======
1. Research on intelligent game confrontation decision-making method of unmanned aerial vehicle in denial operation.
2. Research on the Guidance Theory of Multi-interceptor Formation Cooperative Mid-air Under Complex Interference Conditions.
3. UAV combat model construction and effectiveness evaluation.
4. Distributed cooperative detection of unmanned aerial vehicles
5. Research on the dispatching system technology of multiple mobile robots.
   (We conducted an in-depth investigation on the current research status of the domestic and foreign AGV dispatching system in the route planning technology, the AGVdispatching system's general compatibility with different navigation methods, and thewheel train AGV. According to the project requirements of the AGV system, optimize thedevelopment of the AGV scheduling system framework. Through the host computersoftware: console application Kernel, configuration program Kernel Control Center,control program Plant Overview and Web page program iCloudy, the path planningoptimization and the communication adaptation drive of AGV are realized. And thefunctions completed by modular design are: map model construction, traffic managementand operation and maintenance monitoring.)
6. Research on real-time force feedback method of automatic plastic thatch system.
   ( On the basis of the stress deformation analysis, displacement coordination research and speed synchronization research of the plastic thatch system, the real-time force parameter feedback on the traction rope is established. Then the automatic plastic thatch information transmission system network is built based on the real-time force feedback pulley pair structure design, force sensor selection and data transmission scheme design. Finally, data collection, equipment management, route optimization and data statistical analysis are carried out for the entire production process to build an automated and intelligent real-time state feedback management and control model for the production process in the intelligent manufacturing environment.)
